## Domain of Interest
**1. Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

Today, there are 37.9 M people around the world that are living with HIV and 3.2 M people are under the age of 15 years old. Every day there are more than 5,700 people who contracted HIV which is nearly 240 people per hour. The BF1 group is interested in this topic because we want to further explore where (globally) and who (demographic) have more HIV prevalence and where/who are getting access to HIV treatment. In addition, the group would like to know what age group is most affected by HIV.

**3. What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?**

- **Q:** What kind of disparities do we see when it comes to receiving treatment?
- **Q:** Which specific populations are affected globally?
- **Q:** Which racial and gender groups are most affected by HIV?
- **Q:** Which age groups are most affected by HIV?
- **Q:** What is the average life expectancy by age, race, region?
- **Q:** Has the rate of HIV diagnosis’  changed within the past decade? How so?
- **Q:** What is the GDP level of the countries with higher rates of HIV?  

These questions will leads the Group BF1 to find data that shows which continent(s) has more HIV globally and which continent(s) have more access to HAART HIV treatment.

- **How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**
  - This data was generated through Spectrum, which is an UNAIDS supported software. As mentioned on their page, demographers, epidemiologists and evaluation specialists stationed around the world, collect these findings and report them to UNAIDS. The presented data indicates the global percentages of people diagnosed with HIV. The report also categorizes this data by age, gender, and region.

   - In the _Global HIV Data_ report  has  **7 rows.**

  - UNAIDS, USA Government (particularly through the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR) and the Global Fund are converging efforts to achieve the Fast-Track targets. Data released recently by PEPFAR show that a rapid scale-up of prevention and treatment in the places and among people most in need has enabled three African nations hard-hit by HIV— Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe—to begin controlling their epidemics in adult populations.
