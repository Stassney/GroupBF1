## Introduction

### The purpose/importance of the project

###### Today, there are 37.9 M people around the world living with HIV and 3.2 M people are under the age of 15 years old.
###### Every day there are more than 5,700 people who contracted HIV which is nearly 240 people per hour.
###### This project will further explore where (globally) and who (demographic) have more HIV prevalence and where/who are getting access to HIV treatment.

### The source of the data of the project

###### We found our data from
https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/UNAIDS_FactSheet_en.pdf

## Conclusion

#### Pie Chart

For each major takeaway, you should include the following:

- A description of the notable data-insight or pattern discovered in your project

#### A notable data trend or insight discovered from this project is that
#### Middle East, North Africa along with other Low Income Countries (LIC) are
#### are being affected the most from HIV and have higher death rates.

- A specific piece of data, table, or chart that demonstrates the pattern/insight (**3 points**)

#### According to the data table,
#### South Sudan with (9,900 K deaths in 2018),
#### Myanmar, Middle East and North Africa are areas
#### with the highest HIV prevalence which means that
#### this areas are not benefiting with HAART Therapy.

- The broader implications of the insight (**2 points**)

#### Italy have the least amount of deaths (710 deaths in 2018),
#### Which can means a few things and they are;
#### Italy have better access to HAART Therapy unlike South Sudan,
#### or that Italy has less people that contracted HIV,
#### and Italy's population is less smaller than other countries.

#### Scatter Plot

- A description of the notable data-insight or pattern discovered in your project.

#### A notable data trend or insight discovered from this project is that
#### Namibia (92%), Italy ((91%), and Portugal (90%) have the highest percentage
#### of people receiving HAART Therapy.

- A specific piece of data, table, or chart that demonstrates the pattern/insight (**3 points**)

#### One specific data that was alarming was that
#### Madagascar only receive 9 percent of the population
#### received the HAART Therapy unlike High Income Countries (HIC)
#### who receives about 90 percent or more.

- The broader implications of the insight (**2 points**)

#### According to our data, we can indicate that High Income Countries
#### have better access to HAART Therapy and receiving/benefiting
#### to the therapy than Low Income Countries.

#### Bar Graph

- A description of the notable data-insight or pattern discovered in your project (**2 points**)

#### A notable data trend or insight discovered from this project is that
#### due to the unequal distribution of HAART Therapy in different regions
#### of the world, Low Income Countries are being affected the most.

- A specific piece of data, table, or chart that demonstrates the pattern/insight (**3 points**)

#### Countries such as Madagascar, South Sudan, and other African Countries
#### have the highest death rate while having the lowest
#### number of HAART therapy being received.

- The broader implications of the insight (**2 points**)

#### We can imply that High Income Countries have less death rates
#### Due to the having more access to HARRT Therapy unlike
#### Low Income Countries.
